Create a guide, add navigation, build and audit it, then refresh its agent documentation.

## Regenerate the agent documentation bundle

- Use `frameworkCli` from **Install the site dependencies**: The pinned Shoalrun package installed for this site.

Export the already built site for the framework’s next documentation snapshot:

```sh
npm run agent-docs:build
```

Build the site first. The export copies that output without rebuilding and records the site build identity and pinned package integrity in `agent-docs/provenance.json`. It does not modify the installed package.

Review and transfer the export as a versioned artifact to the framework repository. Framework releases consume an explicitly selected snapshot; they must not fetch the latest site during a package build.

Save `agentBundle`: The exported Markdown, manifest, search index, and provenance under agent-docs.

**Continue when:** The command reports matching counts of bundled Markdown pages and search records.
