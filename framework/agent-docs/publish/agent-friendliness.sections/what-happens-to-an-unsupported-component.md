**Page reading path** — these links apply to the full page.

**Read first**

- [Publishing and agent representations](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/output.md) — Know which HTML, Markdown, and manifest files the build writes.

**Next steps**

- [Connect an MCP client](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/mcp.md) — Connect a tool-capable client to bundled or built documentation.

- [Content negotiation](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/content-negotiation.md) — Serve the Markdown twin when an agent asks for it.

Shoalrun lets people use an interactive documentation page while agents read a Markdown copy of the same instructions. Tabs, closed disclosures, and reader choices should not make essential content disappear from that copy.

The build checks that it knows how to turn each component into readable Markdown. If it does not, it stops with an error. Each generated Markdown page also has a SHA-256 digest, a fingerprint of its bytes. An agent can compare it with the fetched file to verify that the bytes match the published manifest.

Try the example below. Switch the client tab, open **Retry detail**, and choose a reader. Then compare what is visible with the Markdown underneath, which retains both clients, the retry advice, and both reader sections. You can also open [this page's actual Markdown](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/agent-friendliness.md).

## What happens to an unsupported component?

A component needs rendering support for both HTML and Markdown. The compiler calls that support an **adapter**. If a page uses an unknown component such as the one below, Shoalrun stops rather than publishing a Markdown file that silently loses its contents.

```mdx
<UnregisteredPanel>

This instruction must not disappear.

</UnregisteredPanel>
```

Running `shoalrun check docs.config.yaml` reports a diagnostic containing:

```text
<UnregisteredPanel> has no semantic/Markdown adapter
```

The example is displayed as code here so you can read it. A test also runs it as an actual component, checks that compilation fails, and verifies that the previous successful output remains intact. This check establishes how unsupported components are handled; it does not prove that every supported component or authored instruction is correct.
