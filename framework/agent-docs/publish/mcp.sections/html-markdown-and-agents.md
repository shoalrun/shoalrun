- [Measure MCP tool usage](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/mcp-analytics.md) — Optionally measure tool calls through a server adapter.

Connect an MCP client to built documentation through read-only tools. Use stdio for a client-launched local process, or enable an HTTP endpoint on Node or in a generated Vercel function. Both use the same search and Markdown reading core.

The HTTP endpoint currently supports one explicitly selected public publication. The generated Vercel endpoint is deployed and verified on this site. Netlify and Cloudflare adapters aren't implemented. Analytics is off by default; an optional [server adapter](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/mcp-analytics.md) can measure tool calls.

You need Node.js 22.12 or newer, the installed Shoalrun CLI, and a client that supports MCP stdio or Streamable HTTP. Follow [Getting started](https://www.shoalrun.com/start.md) to install the public npm package.

## HTML, Markdown, and agents

The website’s native publication dropdown groups rendered releases by product for HTML navigation. Its labels may hide a single language, but the language remains part of every publication coordinate. MCP clients receive those coordinates as structured data instead of operating the dropdown. Page and section tools return the selected publication’s generated Markdown; they don't combine content from another product with the same page ID. Reader-marked sections remain in published Markdown, while customer profile feature exclusions are removed during compilation.
