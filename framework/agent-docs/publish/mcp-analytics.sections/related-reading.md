Add a server adapter to measure calls to your [HTTP MCP endpoint](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/mcp.md). Analytics is off by default. Enabling MCP does not enable tracking, and the browser analytics setting does not count tool calls.

Your adapter chooses the service and sends the events. Shoalrun packages it for Node or the generated Vercel function. This setting does not instrument stdio, direct Markdown requests, or browser page views.
