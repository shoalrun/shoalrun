Publish documentation for different releases, channels, and languages from one content source. Keep common instructions in one file and select the content that changes between publications. If you document multiple products, each can have its own versions and defaults.

A **publication** identifies a product, channel, version, and language. For a site without product catalogs, it identifies just channel, version, and language. These coordinates determine which page variant readers and agents receive, including its route, links, and search scope.

This guide uses two fictional products, Payments and Reporting, to show independent releases. They're example names you replace with your own product IDs and labels.

A Git branch or tag chooses *which revision of the repository to build*; it doesn't automatically create a documentation version. See [publish separate docs sites from Git](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/revisions.md) for that workflow. For audience or region selection using facets, see [build sites from shared content](https://www.shoalrun.com/publish/single-source-sites.md).
