- [Page metadata](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/frontmatter.md) — Know which fields a new page needs before you pre-fill them.

A template supplies the starting page for a new one: commented frontmatter and a body of prompts. It tells authors and agents what to write, in what order, and what to delete. `scaffold` copies the template once and fills in the draft fields. The result is an ordinary page that authors can change. Editing a template later affects future drafts, not pages already scaffolded.

Use a [snippet](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/snippets.md) when the same prose must stay shared across several pages. Templates guide the initial draft; they do not enforce a permanent page structure.

## Project-added templates

Project templates are named entries under `templates` in config. They are available only in projects that register them; installing the CLI does not provide these names. Use a custom name to add an outline, or a built-in name to override its starting content.

A project template with the same name as a built-in takes precedence. For example, registering `how-to` replaces its starting outline in that project. Use a distinct name to add a choice instead. Neither registration nor overriding rewrites existing pages.
