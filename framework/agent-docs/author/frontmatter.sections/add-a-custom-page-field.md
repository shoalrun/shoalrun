**Page reading path** — these links apply to the full page.

**Read first**

- [Content and stable IDs](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/content.md) — Understand stable IDs and publication variants first.

**Next steps**

- [Templates](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/templates.md) — Pre-fill these fields in the starting points for new pages.

- [Design and enforce a page taxonomy](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/taxonomy.md) — Define allowed page categories and enforce your project's taxonomy.

Frontmatter is the YAML header between the first two `---` lines of a `.md` or `.mdx` page. It gives a page its identity, URL, and publication settings. Start with this complete header, then write the page body below it:

```yaml
---
id: guide.first-page
title: Your first page
summary: Create and publish a page in your documentation site.
type: guide
slug: /first-page
channel: production
version: current
language: en
access: { policy: public }
---
```

Keep `id` stable when you rename a file or change its URL. Use it in [navigation](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/navigation.md) and links such as `[Your first page](doc:guide.first-page)`. To try the full workflow, [add a page](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/add-page.md).

See the [generated frontmatter reference](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/frontmatter-reference.md) under **Write documentation** for native and project-defined fields. Each build also writes `.shoalrun/frontmatter-reference.md` and `.shoalrun/frontmatter.schema.json` beside `docs.config.yaml` for local authoring.

## Add a custom page field

[Declare field types and public export eligibility](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/custom-metadata.md) in the advanced metadata guides.
