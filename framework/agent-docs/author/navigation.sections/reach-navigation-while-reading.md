The `navigation` setting controls the site's left menu. It can be a list in `docs.config.yaml` or import a separate YAML file. Add guides, tutorials, concepts, and reference pages by their stable document IDs. Nodes appear in the order you write them.

Each node has a stable `id` for the menu entry. It needs exactly one of these targets:

- `doc` places any page, including a guide or API reference, by its stable document ID.
- `label` with `items` makes a group of pages or nested groups.
- `operation` places an API reference by stable operation ID.
- `generated` fills in API references from the registered OpenAPI source.

The menu follows document IDs rather than file paths or slugs. Moving a source file or changing a page URL does not require a navigation edit. A `doc` node uses the page title by default; set `label` when the menu needs a shorter name. Pages omitted from navigation can still be built and linked from other pages.

## Reach navigation while reading

Desktop pages keep the sidebar and page outline visible. Keyboard skip links appear on focus without adding a row above the article. The HTML places the article before the full site navigation.

On smaller screens, the page outline moves into an **On this page** disclosure below the introduction. Selecting a heading closes the disclosure and focuses the heading. Escape closes the navigation drawer; when the navigation filter contains text, the first Escape clears it. Without JavaScript, the outline remains below the article and is reachable through a skip link.
