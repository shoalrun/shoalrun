The `navigation` setting controls the site's left menu. It can be a list in `docs.config.yaml` or import a separate YAML file. Add guides, tutorials, concepts, and reference pages by their stable document IDs. Nodes appear in the order you write them.

Each node has a stable `id` for the menu entry. It needs exactly one of these targets:

- `doc` places any page, including a guide or API reference, by its stable document ID.
- `label` with `items` makes a group of pages or nested groups.
- `operation` places an API reference by stable operation ID.
- `generated` fills in API references from the registered OpenAPI source.

The menu follows document IDs rather than file paths or slugs. Moving a source file or changing a page URL does not require a navigation edit. A `doc` node uses the page title by default; set `label` when the menu needs a shorter name. Pages omitted from navigation can still be built and linked from other pages.

## Fill an API tag group

Set `api` and `tag` on a group, then add `generated: remaining` inside `items`:

```yaml
- id: reports-tools
  label: Reports tools
  api: payments
  tag: Reports
  items:
    - id: reports-rest
      generated: remaining
```

The build rejects unknown operation IDs, duplicate placements, and duplicate tag generators.
