A **recipe** is the complete page someone follows to finish a task. An **ingredient** is a reusable piece of source documentation used to write that page. A **cookbook** is a page that helps readers choose a recipe.

Readers can open a recipe directly. Ingredients help authors maintain instructions shared by several recipes. A cookbook becomes useful when readers need help choosing which complete task to follow.

## What changing an ingredient updates

A generated recipe is a snapshot of its ingredients. Editing an ingredient does not immediately change a published recipe. Regenerate the affected recipe, review the changes, and rebuild the site.

Shoalrun's five repository recipes have a maintenance script that updates their snapshots together and a test that detects stale snapshots. The [composition guide](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/recipe-drafts.md) shows that workflow. Other projects can keep generated recipes as drafts and edit them independently.

For example, if the docs build command changes, update the build ingredient once and regenerate the recipes that use it. The cookbook continues pointing to the same published recipe IDs.
