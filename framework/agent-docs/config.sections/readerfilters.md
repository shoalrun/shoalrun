- [How Shoalrun works](https://www.shoalrun.com/concepts.md) — Understand publications, stable IDs, and config composition before changing settings.

A project's config starts at `docs.config.yaml`. The CLI looks for that name by default, and `shoalrun scaffold -n` searches parent directories for it. For the configuration workflow, composition rules, and debugging, start with [configure your project](https://www.shoalrun.com/configuration.md). This page lists every top-level key. Keys with a dedicated guide link there for the full rules. For complete, working configs, see [example configs](https://www.shoalrun.com/config/examples.md).

The root file must be a YAML mapping with `schemaVersion: 1`. YAML is parsed strictly: duplicate keys fail. Any top-level key not listed here fails with `unknown setting <key>`. Keys nested inside `site`, `apis`, `publications`, and `outputs` are not all checked yet, so check spelling there carefully.

```yaml title="docs.config.yaml"
schemaVersion: 1
site:
  title: Example documentation
publications:
  defaults: { channel: production, version: current, language: en }
  channels:
    production: { pathPrefix: "" }
  versions:
    current: { pathPrefix: "" }
  enabled:
    - { channel: production, version: current }
navigation: { $include: ./config/nav.yaml }
```

## `readerFilters`

Optional reader views for one site. `facets` maps each stable facet ID to a reader-facing `label` and an `options` map of stable choice IDs to labels. `typeDefaults` optionally marks all pages of a document type unless a page supplies a value for that facet. `controls` selects sidebar and header pickers; `module` names a local browser module for custom controls. The first visit shows all content. See [reader views](https://www.shoalrun.com/author/reader-views.md) for page and section marks, controls, saved choices, and share links.

```yaml title="docs.config.yaml"
readerFilters:
  facets:
    audience:
      label: Reader
      options: { ui: Use the UI, developer: Build with the API }
  typeDefaults:
    api-reference: { audience: [developer] }
```
