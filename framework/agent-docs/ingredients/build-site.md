**Updated: 2026-10-18.**

Use the installed CLI to build Shoalrun's documentation:

```sh
npx --no-install shoalrun build docs/docs.config.yaml docs/dist
```

The source configuration is `docs/docs.config.yaml`; output goes to `docs/dist`. The root shortcut is `npm run docs:build`; it uses the installed package.

If the build fails, fix the named source or configuration issue and rerun it. A previous successful output can remain on disk after a failure, so file existence alone is not evidence of a successful new build.
